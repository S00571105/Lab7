## Executive Summary 
This section discussed the object oriented programming and allowed the practice of creating and diagramming software. Also it gave the opportunity to practice working with files, folders and exploring the impact of file/folder compressing.

## File Compression
File compression is the process of making computer files take up less space on your computer by reducing the size of a file. When a file is compressed, it uses less storage space so it can save room in memory or on disk drives and since it's smaller, it can be sent and received faster over computer networks. Much like pushing trash down in a waste basket, file compression packs data into a smaller digital form.

### Purpose of File Compression
It is a data compression method in which the logical size of a file is reduced to save disk space for easier and faster transmission over a network or internet.
