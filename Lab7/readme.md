## Executive Summary 
This section discussed the object oriented programming and allowed the practice of creating and diagramming software. Also it gave the opportunity to practice working with files, folders and exploring the impact of file/folder compressing.

## File Compression
File compression is the process of making computer files take up less space on your computer by reducing the size of a file. When a file is compressed, it uses less storage space so it can save room in memory or on disk drives and since it's smaller, it can be sent and received faster over computer networks. Much like pushing trash down in a waste basket, file compression packs data into a smaller digital form.

### Purpose of File Compression
It is a data compression method in which the logical size of a file is reduced to save disk space for easier and faster transmission over a network or internet. 

### Compression and File Size
The SVG file originally was 8kb when compressed it became 2kb. The difference in file with compression was 6kb. If the file was a jpg files already have a format that contains a compression feature so you may not achieve improved results when zipping these files.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
Python is an object-oriented programming language. Object-oriented programming (OOP) focuses on creating reusable patterns of code, in contrast to procedural programming, which focuses on explicit sequenced instructions.

### Attributes:
This defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is instantiated from a class. In the shark example the  Shark object sammy is using the two methods swim() and be_awesome(). We called these using the dot operator (.), which is used to reference an attribute of the object. In this case, the attribute is a method and it’s called with parentheses, like how you would also call with a function.

### Methods:
Are a special  kind of function that are defined within a class. In the shark example they are swimming and being awesome, these are easily identified because self in the function of these arguments which is a reference to objects based on this class.

### Constructor:
The constructor method is used to initialize data. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.

### Class vs. Object
One of the most important concepts in object-oriented programming is the distinction between classes and objects.  Class is a blueprint created by a programmer for an object. This defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is instantiated from this class. Whereby object is an instance of a class. This is the realized version of the class, where the class is manifested in the program. Both are used to create patterns and then make use of the patterns.To instantiate an object means the same thing as creating an object.

## Object Oriented Concepts
Include instantiated, inheritance and encapsulated/abstraction.

### Instantiated Objects
To instantiate an object means the same thing as creating an object.In the shark example there are lines that have “init” in them i.e. self, name and age.

### Inheritance
Inheritance is the mechanism of making new classes from existing ones. In the shark example they are swim and be awesome.

### Encapsulation and Abstraction
Encapsulation is the mechanism of binding the data together and hiding them from the outside world and abstraction is the behavior of the real world. When the students name and age are bound together.

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
The shark class diagram shows the use of UML flowchart symbols to show how the shark class program used the class method that defined two functions one for swimming and one for awesome.

## Conclusion
In conclusion this section was very interesting. The section discussed the object oriented programming and allowed the practice of creating and diagramming software. Also it gave the opportunity to practice working with files, folders and exploring the impact of file/folder compressing.
